A Quantitative Evaluation Model for Distributed Ledger Technologies to Increase Transparency in the Supply Chain

The spreadsheet in this repository provides the user with an evidence-based quantitative model for selecting the best-fitting distributed ledger design for a specific use case. The user must define the relevance of the parameters for the use case, and the model outputs the best DLT design. 

Jakob Gmoser developed the model in his master thesis at the Chair of Industrial Logsitics, Montanuniversit√§t Leoben. For methodological details, please refer to:
